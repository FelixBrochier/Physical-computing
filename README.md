# Physical-computing

In this project, the aim was to create a robot with user interaction, in any shape.
My robot is called ROBOGUESS, and is an interactive between 2 players, including a betting system.
The robot outputs information using an LCD screen, and gets information transmitted through a remote control.
When started,  the user places their bets in the robot, which locks the bets. The robot then inputs 2 cards, one to each user.
He then randomly who goes first. The aim of each player is to guess the other player's card.
The firt player inputs a value, and the robot answers whether he is right, of if the actual card's value is higher or lower than his input.
It is then the other player's turn. The first player to guess the right value wins gets the code of the safe, and can access his gains
